The Dixit Project in Angular is a web application for playing the engaging card game Dixit. Dixit is a game for families and friends that requires creativity and imagination.

## Game Rules

1. Players take turns being the "storyteller." The storyteller selects a card from their hand and describes it using words, phrases, or a story.
2. Other players choose a card from their hand that they believe matches the storyteller's description.
3. The collected cards are shuffled and placed on the table.
4. Players vote on which card they believe belongs to the storyteller.
5. Points are scored based on which cards players choose.
